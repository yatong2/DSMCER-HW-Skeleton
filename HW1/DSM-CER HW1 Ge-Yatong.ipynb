    "* Due date, submitted to your GitHub account by Thur Jan 12, 2017 at 5 pm PST \n",
    "* Overview: This HW assignment is primarily designed to introduce you to some aspects of Data Science and clean energy research.  A secondary goal of the HW assignment is to get practice with git, GitHub classroom and related tools you will be using in Professor Beck's class. \n",
    "* Instructions: \n",
    "    * Check out this python notebook (DSM-CER HW1 skel) from GitHub classroom (if you are reading this, you probably did it). If you had a friend give you the python notebook, stop now and figure out how to get the correct starter code from GitHub classroom.\n",
    "        * Rename the notebook as: \"DSM-CER HW1 _lastname_-_firstname_\"\n",
    "    * Do the assigned reading for DSM-CER (The Data Science review article by Beck et al.).  If you have any lingering questions, enter them in the appropriate cell below, in markdown format and colored in <font color='red'>_red text_</font>\n",
    "    * Find a research paper related to your own research area, or a research area of interest that is at the intersection of materials/chemicals science/engineering and Data Science. In the appropriate cell below, add the correct <a href=\"http://google.com\" target=\"_blank\">link to the paper</a> so that we can find it. \n",
    "        * If you cannot find a paper you want to read you can look for papers related to Materials Genome Initative, The Materials Project, Harvard Clean Energy Project, The Open Quantum Materials Database, or references from Part 1.  \n",
    "            * _If you still can't find a paper, talk to us on Slack or come to office hours_\n",
    "                * **_If you still can't find a paper, I am out of suggestions_**\n",
    "    * Write a brief (200 words or fewer) summary of the paper, making sure to note the methods that were used as well as how the authors addressed one or more data-related challenges \n",
    "    * Turn in the completed python notebook using GitHub classroom"
